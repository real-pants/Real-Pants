RealPants.com, a new literature-based website, to launch January 1, 2015 Website to feature content on a TV-like schedule We are excited to announce Real Pants, a new website devoted to literary conversation. The goal of the site is to pique the interest of people who love books, whether they are writers themselves or busy professionals who barely find time to read on the train, or whether they have a stack of used paperbacks on their nightstand or belong to an eBook club like Oyster. Real Pants asserts that literature is about more than books—it encompasses human interaction in general—and our audience is accordingly broad.

Real Pants offers a fresh take on literature and publishing, with writing that goes beyond the kinds of book reviews and author interviews that so many places already do well. We hope to spark and sustain discussion and energize a diverse literary community.

The most unique feature of Real Pants is its format, which is a roster of columns—or “Beats” as we call them—that run at scheduled times, in the same way that TV shows are programmed for the same spot each week. There is already an exciting array of Beats, including a style column, book reviews focused on design, a craft Beat that highlights things like baseball and country music, and a feature on food in new books.

The site, which is ad-based and pays its contributors, will also feature comics, a podcast about the publishing process, and a poetry reading series. Real Pants will also partner with other organizations to host occasional events, like a party in Brooklyn to celebrate John Dermot Woods’s new book, The Baltimore Atrocities (from Coffee House Press).

Some of the Beat writers include Leesa Cross-Smith, Elisa Gabbert, Justin Taylor, Amber Sparks and many more, as well as a handful of HTMLGiant alums: Kristen Iskandrian, Mike Young, and Mark Cugini among them. Web developer Dylan Kinnett designed RealPants.com and has certified it “mobile ready and future proof.”

Real Pants is loosely housed under the auspices of Publishing Genius, a press that has released more than 40 books of poetry and innovative fiction since 2006. There will be no official crossover between entities, although Adam Robinson, PGP’s founding editor, will take the role of publisher for the new site. Amy McDaniel, founder of 421 Atlanta and author of Selected Adult Lessons (Agnes Fox Press), is the executive editor. For more information, you can email us at amy@realpants.com or adam@realpants.com. And, on January 1, we invite you to direct your favorite browser to www.realpants.com.
